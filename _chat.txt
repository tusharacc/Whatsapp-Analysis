A new museum just opened on the East Coast Road in Chennai and no, it is not full of stuffy artefacts. In fact, you and your family are likely to go berserk taking selfies with the interactive 3D art on display here – it is so much fun!! The talented powerhouse behind this amazing effort is artist AP Shreethar.
All 24 art pieces in this museum have been painted on the wall. But viewers have to stand on the markings on the floor in front of them in order to be a part of the paintings.

26/07/16, 6:22:57 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Can't always say what we think 😝
26/07/16, 6:25:27 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: What did u want to say ?😝
26/07/16, 6:26:24 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Thomas sir said he was nervous no, I thought of saying "Sir you also need a challenge no" but it sounds too arrogant 😝
26/07/16, 6:27:11 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Yea I don't think u should say that😝since he is much older 😁
26/07/16, 6:28:35 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Exactly 😝 The other option was, "Sir this is nothing compared to what your session will be" but that sounds fake 😅

26/07/16, 8:12:48 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Gopika's statement that boys should be taller and beefier is just to make her feel good about herself
26/07/16, 8:14:36 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And Tushar reacts very strongly to my words cos he has neither of those 2 physical attributes😝😝😝😝
26/07/16, 8:15:58 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I never had any insecurity related to my appearance
26/07/16, 8:16:16 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Hence my nonchalance reply is irritating Gopika

26/07/16, 8:25:24 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Digital meter is already there but I haven't read about getting real time feedback
26/07/16, 8:28:00 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: Tushar, next time we ask you what's up, I want you to say anything other than - light, ceiling, AC vent, fan, roof, above apartment, sky, and

26/07/16, 8:49:26 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: Like if I open a door, how many calories i burn.

26/07/16, 8:52:24 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: Eg- automatic food packing, intelligent traffic control
26/07/16, 8:53:12 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ok😝usually ppl who go to gym only are very finicky abt calorie count and all
26/07/16, 8:53:54 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: I know. But I'm so evolved that I started being finicky about it before i went to gym
26/07/16, 8:54:07 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: Intelligent traffic control - based on number of vehicles in a lane, green signal will be ON or OFF for different times. If the vehicle in lane 1 is more and in lane 2 there are less no of vehicles, then lane 1 will have green for long no of time than lane 2

26/07/16, 9:03:20 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: I was appointed president of French Club 👍🏻
26/07/16, 9:04:36 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Preethi....I am not sure what those guys did....but you can work on that idea and make it better....like putting predictive analysis
26/07/16, 9:04:44 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Giving patterns
26/07/16, 9:05:00 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: I didn't tell that iot project
26/07/16, 9:05:06 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: We had some other idea
26/07/16, 9:05:10 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Notifying the user...if there is spike in usage
26/07/16, 9:05:12 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Ohhhh
26/07/16, 9:05:31 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Traffic one is good
26/07/16, 9:05:46 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: One guy is doing it already 😫
26/07/16, 9:06:02 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: All ideas I saw is either in process/already done😫😫
26/07/16, 9:06:11 PM: Tushar Saurabh: So...what
26/07/16, 9:06:14 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Is there a device for a blind person, like he'll experience pressure in four different places as feedback from four sensors  if an obstacle is close by in all four directions
26/07/16, 9:06:14 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: I will tell that iot power consumption thing
26/07/16, 9:06:37 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Just because graham bell was working on telephone...others didn't stop
26/07/16, 9:06:47 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: One team is doing path tracking system for blind
26/07/16, 9:07:39 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Arjun....that one also I was thinking...but my idea was doing video processing which means lot of cameras needed
26/07/16, 9:07:45 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: What's the use of doing exact same project? If it is different even a little, they wont say anything
26/07/16, 9:07:50 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Another one for the blind. They use braille to read, so a braille printer, like just one screen where the projections will change like turning a page
26/07/16, 9:08:30 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Obstacle sensor is easier than video processing. Just four ir sensors? 🤔
26/07/16, 9:08:48 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yeah...obstacle sensor would be easier
26/07/16, 9:09:27 PM: Tushar Saurabh: By the way ...obstacle sensor means...emitting wave and checking if it is reflected
26/07/16, 9:09:35 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Or that is something else
26/07/16, 9:10:20 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Yeah it's the same
26/07/16, 9:10:59 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: The main challenge is to create a wireless sensor which measures power consumption.
26/07/16, 9:11:05 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: Preethi. You require an action to be automated?
26/07/16, 9:11:05 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: Do they already exist?
26/07/16, 9:11:28 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: If it's good and easy I will take it janani😝
26/07/16, 9:11:35 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: But do tell your suggestions
26/07/16, 9:11:40 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: I'm asking my brother Preethi . 😝
26/07/16, 9:12:20 PM: Preethi Medley Toastmasters: Hahahaa okie

26/07/16, 9:17:24 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Preethi...easiest way is to take a digital meter and hook it up with wifi to send data
26/07/16, 9:17:41 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: Yes, Preethi.
26/07/16, 9:18:49 PM: Janani Medley Toaatmasters: :)

28/07/16, 2:56:48 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Ramchandar Guha is slightly impartial.....he avoiding thrusting his opinion
28/07/16, 2:57:45 PM: Tushar Saurabh: People like pupul Jayakar or even advani's book are personal opinion rather than an historian view of past events
28/07/16, 2:58:39 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ohh nice
28/07/16, 2:58:48 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ya he is a very famous historian
28/07/16, 3:59:58 PM: Tushar Saurabh: People speak highly of Hindu, personally I never liked the paper. In the book they mentioned that Hindu tied The line set by Indira Gandhi during emergency
28/07/16, 4:00:12 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Hence more reason for me to not read the paper
28/07/16, 4:01:57 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Really ?
28/07/16, 4:02:15 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ppl generally say TOI is too commercial and not issue oriented
28/07/16, 4:02:24 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Most find hindi good
28/07/16, 4:02:28 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: * u
28/07/16, 4:02:40 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: There are few who are loyal to INdian express
28/07/16, 4:02:47 PM: Tushar Saurabh: TOI is all about who is dating whom
28/07/16, 4:02:53 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Don't know Abt Deccan chronicle  😁
28/07/16, 4:03:29 PM: Tushar Saurabh: During emergency Indian express was one of the paper that didn't toe Indira Gandhi
28/07/16, 4:04:04 PM: Tushar Saurabh: There is some Dalit protest happening in Gujarat...what is that all about
28/07/16, 4:04:59 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And remember...bhoodan movement by Vinoba Bhave...till now I read that it was success....Ramchandar Guha says...its not
28/07/16, 4:05:31 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Because land given were not amenable to farming
28/07/16, 4:06:11 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ohh that gir forest lion issue in Gujarat
28/07/16, 4:06:46 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Now even lions are able to generate emotions
28/07/16, 4:06:55 PM: Tushar Saurabh: What did those lions do
28/07/16, 4:07:45 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Apparently the lions at gir forest killed cows
28/07/16, 4:07:54 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But some ppl blamed certain Dalits for it
28/07/16, 4:07:59 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And thrashed them
28/07/16, 4:08:15 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I am yet to read abt it in detail😁
28/07/16, 4:08:43 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: The Dalits say that they were only skinning the dead cows
28/07/16, 4:09:10 PM: Tushar Saurabh: These cow zealots will bring down Modi or probably Modi himself asked them to keep Hindutva a burning issue
28/07/16, 4:09:35 PM: Tushar Saurabh: By making all that sacred to Hindus an issue
28/07/16, 4:10:28 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I read an article which said that there are several fringe Hindutva extremist groups..which the BJP have no connection with..in fact these groups think that BJP have become too soft and are not promoting Hindutva
28/07/16, 4:10:40 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They think Modi is soft too
28/07/16, 4:11:21 PM: Tushar Saurabh: In a country where 75% ppl are Hindus why do we need to promote Hindutva
28/07/16, 4:11:42 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ppl who advocate reservation also use these incidents to promote it ..saying that these castes need protection
28/07/16, 4:11:48 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: The incident is of course wrong
28/07/16, 4:11:54 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Btw population of Hindus has come down from 1947 when it was around 83^
28/07/16, 4:12:09 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But ppl who use these things to support reservation are stupid
28/07/16, 4:12:23 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ohh
28/07/16, 4:12:33 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I will not entirely reject reservation
28/07/16, 4:12:45 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Economic based reservation is fine
28/07/16, 4:12:59 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But I do not support caste based reservation
28/07/16, 4:13:05 PM: Tushar Saurabh: In India..,.people from low caste have been wronged and they are still on receiving end
28/07/16, 4:13:22 PM: Tushar Saurabh: It should be caste + economic
28/07/16, 4:13:52 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Only those people who belong to SC or ST and are poor should get benefit of reservation
28/07/16, 4:14:04 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: A lot of the lower castes are extremely wealthy
28/07/16, 4:14:14 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: What abt the poor forward castes dude ?
28/07/16, 4:14:32 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I know a lot of high caste ppl who are very poor
28/07/16, 4:15:00 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yes they are poor but socially they are not looked down upon
28/07/16, 4:15:37 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: The point is whether they need help or not..not whether they are looked down or not..can't change ppl's mindset
28/07/16, 4:15:56 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So only thing to do is to indentify ppl who really need help
28/07/16, 4:16:02 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And help them
28/07/16, 4:16:07 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Irrespective of caste
28/07/16, 4:16:27 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Hmm
28/07/16, 4:17:06 PM: Tushar Saurabh: It's not money that impedes the growth
28/07/16, 4:17:34 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: True
28/07/16, 4:17:47 PM: Tushar Saurabh: That's why promote lower caste people so that equal number of people are in position to take decision
28/07/16, 4:17:46 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But mindsets cannot be changed forcibly
28/07/16, 4:18:32 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: We do have legislations like sc , St prevention of atrocities act ..which I have heard is misused a lot
28/07/16, 4:19:48 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: U can of course say that on sc St welfare commission , there should be an sc or an st..or even bc ppl in minorities welfare board..because only they know what are their breeds
28/07/16, 4:19:51 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: * needs
28/07/16, 4:20:12 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But extending that to educational institutions and other arenas are not at all necessary
28/07/16, 4:20:38 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: A lot of ppl nowadays get fake caste certificates done to get benefits of reservation
28/07/16, 4:20:56 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I was telling my friend the other day that it's now the forward castes that need reservation
28/07/16, 4:21:47 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yes it is misused a lot
28/07/16, 4:22:31 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yup...people get fake certificates
28/07/16, 4:22:50 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And u know what , this kind of reservation promotes an animosity between students of different castes ..when a forward caste student loses out on admission despite being meritorious , to a guy who is far from meritorious but comes under reserved category , it is natural that he will develop a feeling of hatred towards the caste itself
28/07/16, 4:23:27 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Even those in the new generation who do not know abt the caste system will know all this while getting admission to any college
28/07/16, 4:23:34 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So this saga will continue
28/07/16, 4:23:40 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Without any full stop😁
28/07/16, 4:23:56 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: To put an end to the caste system , reservation should end
28/07/16, 4:25:32 PM: Tushar Saurabh: You mean reservation on caste basis
28/07/16, 4:25:43 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Yes
28/07/16, 4:26:00 PM: Tushar Saurabh: But I don't think any government has will power to do that
28/07/16, 4:26:17 PM: Tushar Saurabh: RSS opposes caste state yet Modi cannot end it
28/07/16, 4:26:19 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Of course they won't 😁they need votes
28/07/16, 4:27:29 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Then maybe rss should come into power 😝😝
28/07/16, 4:28:01 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Go and read that book....
28/07/16, 4:28:24 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Initially foreigners were so much against Indians
28/07/16, 4:28:53 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And very supportive of Pak
28/07/16, 4:29:42 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ohh

28/07/16, 4:30:11 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And also pak is much more dangerous to them
28/07/16, 4:30:17 PM: Tushar Saurabh: We don't know.... China still supports Pakistan
28/07/16, 4:30:34 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And US always ends up giving aid to Pakistan
28/07/16, 4:30:35 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Chinese are cunning ppl😁
28/07/16, 4:31:00 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Cos they are scared that somebody like Osama shouldn't come up there😝
28/07/16, 4:31:25 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: U know pakistan recognised Taliban ?
28/07/16, 4:31:30 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: As a state
28/07/16, 4:31:36 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So did Saudi Arabia
28/07/16, 4:31:40 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And another country

28/07/16, 4:33:27 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Apparently when Obama was given Nobel PEACE prize , in his lecture he still spoke abt unilateral force and self defence and stuff 😝
28/07/16, 4:33:37 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Exactly @ tushar😁
28/07/16, 4:33:43 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So funny Arjun 😝
28/07/16, 4:33:54 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Even Obama was surprised to get Nobel

28/07/16, 4:35:31 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Doubt: You said even rich SC STs needed reservation cuz they're looked down upon. Explain 🤔
28/07/16, 4:35:32 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They might have given him the peace prize to make America to stop interfering in other countries affairs😝
28/07/16, 4:35:45 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I didn't say that
28/07/16, 4:35:50 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: Tushar
28/07/16, 4:36:08 PM: Arjun Kg Medley Toastmasters: What do you mean by looked down upon

28/07/16, 5:19:07 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Instead of just starving herself with no results ?
28/07/16, 5:38:50 PM: Tushar Saurabh: She was not starving
28/07/16, 5:38:57 PM: Tushar Saurabh: She didn't eat solid food
28/07/16, 5:39:17 PM: Tushar Saurabh: She was sustaining on liquid food which apparently was force fed

28/07/16, 6:51:51 PM: Tushar Saurabh: That region is susceptible to incursion
28/07/16, 6:52:06 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And we have immigration problem from Bangladesh

28/07/16, 7:11:48 PM: Tushar Saurabh: That's a exaggeration. I condemn that statement made with a malicious intent to publicly shame me
28/07/16, 7:12:01 PM: Priyanka Medley Toastmasters: 😂😂

31/07/16, 1:59:42 PM: Anusha Medley Toastmasters: You carry on
31/07/16, 2:00:03 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And there is debate...where journalists are divided in two camps...Arnab Goswami and Barkha Dutt
31/07/16, 2:00:03 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Why would he talk abt ndtv on Kargil divas ?
31/07/16, 2:00:13 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Oh they covered Kargil war na
31/07/16, 2:00:21 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: She was active that time..Barkha
31/07/16, 2:00:26 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yeah
31/07/16, 2:00:45 PM: Tushar Saurabh: That only brought Barkha Dutt fame
31/07/16, 2:00:51 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: What are some of the things he said ?
31/07/16, 2:00:54 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Yea

31/07/16, 2:01:35 PM: Tushar Saurabh: When Taj was seized by terrorists
31/07/16, 2:01:57 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Plus she supported JNU
31/07/16, 2:02:06 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ohh
31/07/16, 2:02:28 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And she spoke against army on burham wani killing
31/07/16, 2:02:46 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Aha
31/07/16, 2:02:51 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But u know
31/07/16, 2:03:02 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Arnab has a habit of taking the popular side
31/07/16, 2:03:21 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I mean the viewpoint which the majority supports
31/07/16, 2:03:32 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And first of all journalist should never take sides
31/07/16, 2:03:51 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They should just give both sides and leave it to the viewers
31/07/16, 2:04:23 PM: Tushar Saurabh: But you don't have such impartial journalists now
31/07/16, 2:04:53 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Hope jansni becomes one 😁
31/07/16, 2:05:00 PM: Tushar Saurabh: You have elites like Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep sardesai and Rahul Kanwal
31/07/16, 2:05:32 PM: Tushar Saurabh: For whom whatever BJP does is against humanity, secularism etc etc
31/07/16, 2:06:00 PM: Tushar Saurabh: These people have made news a drama
31/07/16, 2:06:15 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Yeaa
31/07/16, 2:06:23 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: It's very dangerous ..trial by media
31/07/16, 2:06:31 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Everything is not as it seems
31/07/16, 2:06:42 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So it's wrong when u get to hear filtered news
31/07/16, 2:06:45 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I saw a clipping where Rahul Kanwal says chanting vande Matram is unindian or something
31/07/16, 2:06:55 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Or partial news
31/07/16, 2:07:15 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Appidiya 😁
31/07/16, 2:07:19 PM: Tushar Saurabh: These poeple are business man and not journalist
31/07/16, 2:07:38 PM: Tushar Saurabh: They want TRP that's all
31/07/16, 2:07:54 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: It's stupid cos if u supply news PPl will listen..have debates ..quality ones
31/07/16, 2:07:59 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Nobody asked for drama
31/07/16, 2:09:08 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Quality ones....is far fetched dream
31/07/16, 2:09:15 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I can do it in medley
31/07/16, 2:09:25 PM: Tushar Saurabh: But national television no way
31/07/16, 2:09:34 PM: Tushar Saurabh: People like it
31/07/16, 2:10:17 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: 😁😁
31/07/16, 2:10:32 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Maybe it's a wrong impression that PPl like it
31/07/16, 2:10:50 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I feel it's more than that
31/07/16, 2:11:01 PM: Tushar Saurabh: The moment Modi became prime minister
31/07/16, 2:11:12 PM: Tushar Saurabh: He divided country in two ideology
31/07/16, 2:11:28 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And apparently there is nothing as moderate
31/07/16, 2:11:38 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Either you are extreme left or right
31/07/16, 2:11:53 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Either you are Hindu or you are against India
31/07/16, 2:12:28 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Either you support minorities or you are communal
31/07/16, 2:12:36 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ahh
31/07/16, 2:12:40 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: That's bad
31/07/16, 2:13:28 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: I think Buddhist ideology should be given more publicity 😁follow the 'middle path'😁
31/07/16, 2:13:39 PM: Tushar Saurabh: India as a country is beset with problem
31/07/16, 2:13:46 PM: Tushar Saurabh: True
31/07/16, 2:14:14 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: A change is needed
31/07/16, 2:14:27 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Change in?
31/07/16, 2:15:18 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: In a lot of things 😝
31/07/16, 2:15:56 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I think...just Modi needs to change and be like a leader
31/07/16, 2:16:26 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ya more strong towards certain things
31/07/16, 2:16:31 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I somehow feel that he is letting these things happen to keep Hindutva a burning topic to further his political ambition
31/07/16, 2:16:37 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And not just foreign relations
31/07/16, 2:16:41 PM: Tushar Saurabh: True....
31/07/16, 2:16:53 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But I think he is becoming quite secular 😁
31/07/16, 2:17:08 PM: Tushar Saurabh: But BJP is not
31/07/16, 2:17:33 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: U know something
31/07/16, 2:17:34 PM: Tushar Saurabh: In current scenario it is easier for Pakistan and China to disintegrate India
31/07/16, 2:18:39 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Gandhi was criticised when he said that as part of partition , he said that whoever wanted to go to Pakistan could go ...he didn't divide India and Pakistan on religious basis..Hindus in Pakistan suffer..Muslims in India have problems
31/07/16, 2:18:50 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: That's one of the reasons why Godse shot him
31/07/16, 2:19:04 PM: Tushar Saurabh: That's true
31/07/16, 2:19:07 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Rss felt that in the name of being fair , he did injustice
31/07/16, 2:19:18 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They also felt he was very partial towards Muslims
31/07/16, 2:19:28 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Gandhi thought everyone was like him
31/07/16, 2:19:41 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: He always expected Hindus to have a bigger heart and sacrifice
31/07/16, 2:19:50 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yes
31/07/16, 2:19:51 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Which after an extent is obviously not possible
31/07/16, 2:20:10 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: He had his flaws😁
31/07/16, 2:20:17 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: But defintely a great man
31/07/16, 2:20:30 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Obviously he had....he was human after all
31/07/16, 2:20:43 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Of course😁
31/07/16, 2:21:16 PM: Tushar Saurabh: In fact If Gandhi had lived....India would have suffered a lot
31/07/16, 2:21:29 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Maybe if we were a country with only one religion , we might have enjoyed gud relations with pak..maybe not
31/07/16, 2:21:49 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Would it ?😁how?
31/07/16, 2:22:14 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Nope...I don't think even if all Muslim went to Pakistan ...we would have had cordial relation
31/07/16, 2:22:30 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Islam as an ideology is inherently expansionist
31/07/16, 2:22:43 PM: Tushar Saurabh: They deride other religion
31/07/16, 2:22:45 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ok but at least infighting within the country wouldn't have been there
31/07/16, 2:23:23 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: The PPl maybe..I don't think the religion says so
31/07/16, 2:23:35 PM: Tushar Saurabh: They would have....there are people in Pakistan who think India is theirs because Muslims ruled it for 700 years
31/07/16, 2:23:50 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Really ?😝
31/07/16, 2:23:53 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: How stupid
31/07/16, 2:24:02 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Yup
31/07/16, 2:24:05 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They were invaders

31/07/16, 2:24:38 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Theifs who looted our country
31/07/16, 2:24:43 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Wish we could go back in time and erase things😁
31/07/16, 2:24:56 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And yet enough was their for Britishers to milk it again
31/07/16, 2:24:56 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: First of all I would have burnt East India company 😝
31/07/16, 2:25:17 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: And vasco da gama's ship should have been arrested😝
31/07/16, 2:25:22 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: So should he😝
31/07/16, 2:25:28 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And we as Indians were not united
31/07/16, 2:25:57 PM: Tushar Saurabh: When Mohammed gori....attacked India....all Rajputs didn't fight together
31/07/16, 2:26:07 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Ya I know
31/07/16, 2:26:21 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: It is basic human instinct of self preservation 😁
31/07/16, 2:26:25 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Cost them a lot
31/07/16, 2:26:33 PM: Tushar Saurabh: If they had....Prithviraj Chohwhan would have defeated him
31/07/16, 2:26:44 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Btw
31/07/16, 2:27:37 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: England has refused to give back kohinoor😁
31/07/16, 2:27:42 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: They say it was a gift
31/07/16, 2:27:47 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Even later when Marathas assumed power...there was lot of infigtings which weakened Marathas
31/07/16, 2:28:31 PM: Tushar Saurabh: I read that...I feel it's stupid asking for Kohinoor...they took away billions dollar from here and we are worried about 200 million dollar Kohinoor
31/07/16, 2:28:46 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Yea
31/07/16, 2:28:55 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Better send some art thief to steal it😝

31/07/16, 2:29:29 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And if it comes it will again be a problem
31/07/16, 2:29:41 PM: Tushar Saurabh: Muslims will say they are rightful heir
31/07/16, 2:29:53 PM: Tushar Saurabh: And Sikhs will say they were the last owner
31/07/16, 2:29:55 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Hahahaha😝😝
31/07/16, 2:30:02 PM: Gopika Medley Toaatmasters: Pakistan might demand it😝
